# Yamistore - React + TypeScript + Vite E-Commerce App

Yamistore, my e-commerce project developed with React, is a product of my strong commitment to cutting-edge technology and user satisfaction. It is not just a platform; it offers users an interactive and enjoyable shopping experience with the goal of creating memorable moments.

From the moment you first enter the platform, you will encounter a simple, elegant, and functional design. Every aspect of Yamistore has been carefully crafted for a seamless and intuitive navigation experience. Its responsive design ensures a consistent presentation across various devices.

## Technologies Used

Yamistore is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management library for React.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Formik**: Form library for React.
- **Yup**: Schema validation for JavaScript objects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Instead of using UI libraries, all components and styles were custom-built using Tailwind CSS. This approach allows for complete customization tailored to the project's specific needs, providing more control and consistency in design. The utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS enables greater flexibility and precise adjustments for all UI elements.

## Features
